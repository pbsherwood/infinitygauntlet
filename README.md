# Infinity Gauntlet

I made this back when Endgame came out.

This library randomly places infinity stones around the page (based on selectors your provide on init) and after you gather then and click on the gauntlet, to initiate the "snap", 50% of all pages elements are "deleted"

Check out the example file for more info.
